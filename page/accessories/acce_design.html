        Sakura (桜 Cherry Blossom)
        </p>
        <p class="description">
        Japan's national flower, a cherry blossom reaches its glory in the spring when it blooms delicate pink flowers.  It is all the more beautiful for its fragility, coming into full bloom only to fall within a week or so.  Such gracefulness has been attracting the Japanese for so long that it appears even in classical poems sung more than 1,200 years ago.  Every well-known poet - from the royal families to professional poets to anonymous townspeople - read a cherry blossom as a token of affection, be it love or friendship.  Today, cherry trees are sent as the symbol of peace to historical areas, such as the Washington, D.C. and the remains of the Berlin Wall.  <br><br>

        Shochikubai (松竹梅 Pine, Bamboo, and Plum)
        </p>
        <p class="description">
        The combination of a pine, a bamboo, and a plum typifies an auspicious sign in Japan.  They are often used as decorations for New Year's celebrations or weddings, for the three motifs embody prosperity as they endure winter and flourish in the spring.  The pine has a strong vitality to survive winter even when its needles are puffed with snow.  The bamboo grows, or rather shoots up from under the snow-clad ground, at a rapid speed.  The plum, upon the coming of the thaw, will be the first to bear its sweet pink flowers.  While the first two evergreens represent eternal life, the plum arouses an image of pure nobility.  <br><br>

        Ume (梅 Plum)
        </p>
        <p class="description">
        A plum has long been one of the favourite flowers of the Japanese, for its pink colour and sweet scent.  It gives seemingly opposite images of innocence and strong fibre at the same time, both from how it flourishes during the winter.  Upon the coming of the thaw, a plum bears its flowers before any other plants do.  The contrast, deep pink fluttering in white of the snow, touches hearts of the Japanese so much that it appears in traditional poems almost as often as a cherry blossom, Japan's national flower, does.  Its energy, along with elegance in the visual, has associated a plum with a wish for the sound growth of a new-born baby. <br><br>

        As subjects for the design of NICHIGETSU, the Sun and the Moon are always portrayed in set.  The two have long been associated with principles of Yin and Yang: sometimes as representatives for the positive and the negative, other times as metaphors of male and female.  Together, they imply the universal harmony. <br><br>
        What is unique about Japanese recognition of the two signs, in comparison to other symbolistic points of view, is that we conceive the Moon to be leading the Sun.  Because both are depicted in nearly the same size instead of prioritising as designs these days do, the tint of silver still adds a fresh taste to this classical design.  <br><br>

        Between the end of burning summer and the start of freezing winter, autumn brings with it a sense of faint melancholy.  It is the season of nothingness, where memories of excitement are constantly brought back to call nostalgia.  Such situation feels quite sentimental, but Yamanoue no Okura, on seeing the seven grasses, discovered that there exists certain beauty.  Although the plants are by no means loud, they are beautifully touching - almost holy - in the sense that they reside with your lonesome feelings. <br><br>

        Byakudan (白檀 Sandalwood)
        </p>
        <p class="description">
        Sandalwood, with spicy but gorgeous scent, has evolved worldwide as a fragrant tree for the nobility to relish its aroma.  The Japanese has pursued its possibility further to apply it to lacquer coating, overlaying gold and silver leaf to express this unique amber colour.  <br><br>
        The technique, however, once comes close to going extinct in the emergence of "maki-e."  In order to preserve this tradition of sandalwood coating, YAMADA HEIANDO cast light on its sincere beauty and began our famous "Byakudan" Series (白檀シリーズ the Sandalwood Series).  We excelled the original method and invented a better way to stabilize the hue.  The amber colour, which used to dapple for difficulty in adjusting the drying process to surrounding conditions, now appears in the perfect unison.  It was, and still is, the sandalwood coating technique of our exclusive craftsmen that protected this amber beauty.  <br><br>
