     Collecting Information About You
     </p>
     <p>
     There may be times (such as when you purchase or order an item, subscribe to a service, register to receive catalogs, or to participate in contests, sweepstakes, or promotions, etc.) when we ask you to provide certain contact information about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address, social media user name, credit card information, birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests, and other information.  We may also maintain a record of your item purchases.  
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice.  But if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to purchase products, or access certain services, offers, and contents on our web sites.  In addition, we may need to contact you via phone, email, or mail to address questions or issues specific to your order, entry, etc., even if you have opted to not receive communications from us.  
     </p>
     <p>
     In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any contact information about yourself.  We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us, other electronic markers and identifiers, and other information about our web sites.  We may analyze this data for preferences, trends, site usage statistics and to recognize you.  We may also receive usage data from your mobile phone or other device you use to access our web sites, including location data, which we may also combine with other information.  Unless you voluntarily tell us who you are, individual users will remain anonymous from the information mentioned above.  
     </p>
     <p>
     If you access any of our web sites with your log-in credentials from a social networking site (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) or if you otherwise agree to associate your account with us with a social networking site, we may receive personal information about you from such social networking site, in accordance with the terms of use and privacy policy of the social networking site.  We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our stores and web sites.

     </p>
     <p>
     From time to time we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy policies are consistent with ours.  These are known as our Select Partners.  In such cases we might rent, exchange, share, and/or cross-reference information, including contact information about you that will enable such persons or entities to contact you regarding items and services that may be of interest to you.
     </p>
     <p>
     We may contract with persons or entities to provide certain services, including credit card processing, shipping, data analysis and management, promotional services, etc.  We call them our Service Providers.  We provide our Service Providers with the information needed for them to perform these services.  We also ask our Service Providers to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours.

     <p>
     We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain information when you visit our web sites.  These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about items and services likely to be of interest to you.  These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.  Our systems do not recognize "Do Not Track" signals, but several of these third party companies who utilize these cookies or beacons on our web sites enable you to opt out of this behavioral advertising.

     In certain instances, we may disclose your contact information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to YAMADA HEIANDO Brands, or to others.  We may also disclose your contact information when we believe the law or legal process requires it.

     Security
     </p>
     <p>
     Our web sites use an online shop platform and server provided by our Service Provider Future Shop Co., Ltd., which uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to guard your information delivered to us electronically.  SSL encrypts your name and address, so only YAMADA HEIANDO and Future Shop are able to decode your information.
     </p>
     <p>
     As for your credit card number, it is encrypted and sent to a dedicated payment server run by another Service Provider Future Commerce Co., Ltd.  It is not stored in our own systems in any way.  
     </p>
     <p>
     Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your contact information, to the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our web sites, and you do so at your own risk.
     </p>
     <p>
     We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone.  Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.  This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place, such as a library or an Internet cafe.
