      Classic but Modern.</br>Innovation in Traditions.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
      What makes YAMADA HEIANDO unique as a lacquerware brand is that we create both classic and modern items.  Not only do we inherit Japanese traditions as the proud purveyor of tableware to the Japanese Imperial Household, but also we are constantly searching for new items to develop.  Accessory cases, photo frames, and fountain pens are just a few examples of everyday items that we have chosen to lacquer coat and introduce the concept of lacquerware through.  We thought up original designs for them to blend in with Western style as well, including our popular "Ryu (Dragon)" series.</br></br>
      In the hope that more people will feel connected with the art of lacquerware, we tell stories of contemporary lifestyle to the world via varieties of innovative line up.  We have been the leading company in Japanese lacquerware industry, standing out from others for our clear sense of time.

     All of our lacquerware on this website are priced the same with Japanese online shops and brick-and-mortar stores (2 captive stores in Tokyo, 1 satellite store at the Narita International Airport).  Because we hold pride in our craftsmanship, we take part in every process from creation to delivery instead of distributing them to an agency.  We hope you will feel as if you are walking around the brick-and-mortar store in Japan while browsing through this website.
